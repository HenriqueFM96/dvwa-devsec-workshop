# üéì FortidevSec‚Ñ¢ Fundamentals 


Welcome to FortiDevSec simple demo. A half-hour workshop to demonstrate how easy it can be to create a GitHub actions workflow that aggregates a security layer to your current DevOps practice.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Pre-Requisites

1. Create a FortiDevSec Account 
1. A Github Account to [fork](https://github.com/ampacheco/dvwa-devsec-workshop/fork) this repository and runs github [actions](https://github.com/features/actions) 
1. An [Azure Subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to Deploy [Damn Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA) canonical app to demonstrate DAST feature. In this particular case, it deployed on [Azure Container Instances Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-instances).

## 1. Objectives
   
1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduce FortiDevSec as a simple tool to add a security layer to your current continuous application development workflow<p/>
2Ô∏è‚É£ If you have never used it, introduce GitHub actions as a simple workflow engine to manage the complete lifecycle<p/>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Describe and explain the configuration yaml file required to connect your workflow engine with FortiDevSec<p/>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Describe and explain the steps required to implement SAST and DAST scans.

## 2. The FortiDevSec UI

FortiDevSec is an  application security testing product that offers a comprehensive SaaS based continuous application testing for software developers and devops, without the need for any security expertise.


Navigate to the [Live Demo](https://fortidevsec.forticloud.com/#/secOpsDashboard) to familiarize yourself with the Basic UI, and explore the main dashboard and then the application dashboard.

### üü©Summary of Scanners

|Sacanner|Description|
|---|---|
|**SAST**|Scans the source code of an application during development to minimize zero-day vulnerabilities. The application languages supported for SAST are Shell, Java, Ruby on Rails, Python, Golang, PHP, JavaScript/NodeJS, C and C++.|
|**DAST**|Scans a deployed application at runtime to detect vulnerabilities. The DAST scanner supports scanning of assets/targets hosted on both the internal network of an organization and the external/public network using FortiDAST proxy server. See FortiDAST Proxy Server.|
|**SCA**|Scans for vulnerabilities in the open-source libraries/components used by the application. The programming languages supported by the SCA scanner are Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Golang, and PHP.|
_Others Scanneres ..._
|**Sacanner**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Secret**|Scans to detect certificates and other secrets committed into Git.|
|**IaC**|Scans your IaC configuration files for Terraform, Cloud Formation, Docker and Kubernetes, to detect configuration issues.|
|**Container**|Scans container components to identify potential vulnerabilities.|

## 3. The DevOps Workflow

The number of jobs and steps per job you will end up having in your process depends on the maturity of your current practice. 

These hands-on labs explore how to add SAST and DAST scanner analisys to your current workflow if you have one or bring a ground foundation for a start a DevOps practice with security from the starting point. 

- Build
- Test - ... as many as you have incorporated into your practice and SAST
- Deploy
- DAST 

In this step, we will create the skeleton of the basic Github actions workflow jobs required to complete our job successfully. 

After completing this step, you will be adding steps per job to incorporate: 

1. SAST
1. Deployment of our application to Azure as Azure Container Instance
1. Run DAST Analysis 

For those able to understand the basic workflow, I recommend copying and pasting the yaml in the box into the ./github/workflow/main.yaml file.

To simplify your start, the main file in the repo contains this yaml code. So you will complete the copying/pasting cycling in the following steps as required.
